 Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need ½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Keep aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.
 Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-pestle. You will need 1 tablespoon of crushed ginger-garlic or 1 tablespoon of ready ginger-garlic paste.
 Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use homemade paneer.
 Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till smooth.
 Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the curd. Also add all the dry spice powders. Below you see the following Indian spice powders in clockwise order:

2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
½ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ teaspoon garam masala powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur)
1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
1 teaspoon chaat masala
½ teaspoon black pepper powder (optional)
Kashmiri red chili powder gives a nice red color to the food but is not spicy and hot. Instead of kashmiri red chilli powder, you can add 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika or ½ to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.
